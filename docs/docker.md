Docker Instructions
===================

The docker-compose.yml file describes the SecurityMonkey environment. This is intended for local development with the intention of deploying SecurityMonkey containers with a Docker Orchestration tool like Kubernetes.

The Dockerfile builds SecurityMonkey into a container with several different entrypoints. These are for the different responsibilities SecurityMonkey has. Also, the docker/nginx/Dockerfile file is used to build an NGINX container that will front the API, serve the static assets, and provide TLS.

Quick Start:
------------

Define your specific settings in **secmonkey.env** file. For example, this file will look like:

    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
    SECURITY_MONKEY_POSTGRES_HOST=postgres
    SECURITY_MONKEY_FQDN=127.0.0.1
    # Must be false if HTTP
    SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=False

Next, you can build all the containers by running:

    $ docker-compose build

On a fresh database instance, various initial configuration must be run such as database setup, initial user creation (<admin@example.org> / admin), etc. You can run the `init` container via:

    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.init.yml up -d

Before you bring the containers up, you need to add an AWS account for the scheduler to monitor:

    $ monkey add_account_aws --number $account --name $name -r SecurityMonkey

Now that the database is setup, you can start up the remaining containers (Security Monkey, nginx, and the scheduler) via:

    $ docker-compose up -d

You can stop the containers with:

    $ docker-compose stop

Otherwise you can shutdown and clean the images and volumes with:

    $ docker-compose down

Commands:
---------

    $ docker-compose build [api | scheduler | nginx | data]

    $ docker-compose up -d [postgres | api | scheduler | nginx | data]

    $ docker-compose restart [postgres | api | scheduler | nginx | data]

    $ docker-compose stop

    $ docker-compose down

More Info:
----------

You can get a shell thanks to the docker-compose.shell.yml override:

    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.shell.yml up -d data
    $ docker attach $(docker ps -aqf "name=secmonkey-data")

This allows you to access SecurityMonkey code, and run manual configurations such as:

    $ monkey create_user admin@example.com Admin

and/or:

    $ monkey add_account_aws --number $account --name $name -r SecurityMonkey

This container is useful for local development. It is not required otherwise.

Tips and tricks:
----------------

If you have to restart the scheduler, you don't have to restart all the stack. Just run:

    $ docker-compose restart scheduler

If you want to persist the DB data, create a postgres-data directory in the repository root:

    $ mkdir postgres-data

and uncomment these two lines in docker-compose.yml (in the postgres section):

    #volumes:
    #    - ./postgres-data/:/var/lib/postgresql/data
